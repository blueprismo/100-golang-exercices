// Exercise: Channels directions (only read/rx)

// Make a goroutine with a channel for only receive data.
// The function should be called "receive" and the receive-only channel should be it's 1st and only argument
// Sending data from that channel is prohibited / will cause compiler errors
// Feed some string into that channel.
