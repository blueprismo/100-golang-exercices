# 100 exercices to improve with GOLANG

## Intro

I hadn't find any good repository with 100 exercices for the GO Programming language, and as It's a beautiful language, I will create it myself :smile: feel free to contribute and use it!

The following exercises assume a fairly basic level of object oriented programming, but it is also OK if you don't have it.

## Overview

My main idea is that the exercices are structured like this:

- From 1 to 15   : Basic exercices
- From 16 to 19  : File management
- From 20 to 31  : Intermediate exercices
- From 32 to 44  : Concurrency
- From 45 to 48  : Time
- From 49 to 53  : JSON
- From 54 to 61  : Context
- From 62 to 68  : Interfaces
- From 69 to 82  : HTTP & APIs
- From 83 to 89  : Testing & misc
- From 90 to 100 : Database (non-relational(mongo)) + CRUD API with Fiber

Each folder will contain one exercise and one solution. There are multiple ways to acheive the same reault, so everything counts.

```bash
├── n-th_exercise       # <- exercise number
│    ├── main.go
│    ├── [.env]
│    └── solution       # <- solution folder
│       └── solution.go      
├── go.mod
└── go.sum
```

## Prerequisites

You can read this book however you feel like. But to boost your learning it would be ideal that you have git installed and an [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) of your choice. Visual Studio Code is a great free IDE if you are unsure.

Feel free to [install golang](https://go.dev/doc/install), fork the [100-golang-exercises](https://github.com/blueprismo/100-golang-exercices/fork) repository and you'll be ready to go.

## Note

Please notice there are some exercises that are intended to have an execution failure, the important thing here is learning.
Feel free to contribute, comment, share your solutions and of course have lot of fun!

Thanks a lot
