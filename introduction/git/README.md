# Git

Git is a distributed version control system that tracks versions of files.
It is often used to control source code by programmers who are developing software collaboratively, as an example more than 1000 persons could work in a single project simultaneously without interrupting themselves.

If you have never heard about git and you are interested in coding, it is a tool of vital importance for you to know.

This book text is stored in a git repository, and ideally you should be able to fork the repository so you can execute your code locally and play around.
